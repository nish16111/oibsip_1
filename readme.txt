Task 1:  IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION



The following code falls under the category of Machine Learning for multi-class classification.


My Learnings: 

> To read and manipulate data using pandas

> To understand and use sklearn train_test_split function.

> Using TensorFlow Library for creation of model to learn and make predictions on Iris Flower Dataset.

> Model is created using the Sequential Api.

> Activation functions used are "relu"(rectified Linear Unit), "softmax".

> Loss function used is "categorical_crossentropy"

> Optimizer used is Adam.

> Training Steps/epochs = 20

> Accuracy on Training data = 98.33 %

> Accuracy on Test data  = 100%
